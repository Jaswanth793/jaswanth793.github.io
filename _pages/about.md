Hello, this is Jaswanth. I am a final year student in the Inter-Disciplinary Dual-Degree (IDDD) program at IIT Madras, majoring in computational engineering and material science. My research interests lie broadly across the domains of multi-purpose architected materials, ML-assisted mechanical design and convex optimization. Currently, I am working on the multi-objective optimization of functionally graded BCC lattices for crashworthiness and thermal dissipation at the Mechanics of Materials (MoM) Lab at IIT Madras under the guidance of Prof. Ratna Kumar Annabattula.

The last four years as an undergraduate have been incredibly rewarding as I explored and refined my skills in computational mechanical design. My journey began as a mechanical design engineer with Team Anveshak, the Mars rover team at IIT Madras. What started as a passion for building robots quickly turned into an obsession with the software tools that facilitated the design and testing of virtual rover components. This passion led me to transition into a dual degree program at IIT Madras, where I am majoring in computational engineering.

The coursework I have completed in the computational engineering program has given me a solid foundation in numerical methods, convex optimization, machine learning, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. This foundation, combined with my core knowledge in material science, positions me well for further study and application of this science-backed foundation for tackling real-world design problems.
