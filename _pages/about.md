Hello, this is Jaswanth. I am a final year student in the Inter-Disciplinary Dual-Degree (IDDD) program at IIT Madras, majoring in computational engineering and material science. My research interests lie broadly across the domains of multi-purpose architected materials, ML-assisted mechanical design and convex optimization. Currently, I am working on the multi-objective optimization of functionally graded BCC lattices for crashworthiness and thermal dissipation.

The last four years as an undergraduate have been extremely fruitful as I explored and honed my skills in computational mechanical design, all starting from being the mechanical design engineer at Team Anveshak, the Mars rover team of IIT Madras.
