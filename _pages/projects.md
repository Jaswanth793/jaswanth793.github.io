This page provides a brief overview of the various projects I completed as part of my coursework, extracurricular activities, and personal interests purely driven by curiosity. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Team Anveshak at IIT Madras, where I made significant contributions. I developed my own solver from scratch for the lid-driven cavity problem for my Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) course. This experience, in particular, paired with my interest in mechanical design optimization, sparked my interest in computational engineering.
