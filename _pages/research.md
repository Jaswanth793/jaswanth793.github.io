#### Summary
Welcome! My current research work focuses the design of architected materials that are tailored for multi-purpose applications rather than the traditional approach of single-purpose design. Few research works available in the literature do investigate the possibility of optimizing/designing a structure for multiple applications, but these applications in turn have been within the same phenomenon. For example, optmizing a lattice structure for a lower initial peak stress but higher overall energy absorption. Both of these properties, although different, are governed by the mechanical properties of the material. My interest however, is to explore the possibility of optimizing/discovering lattice structures that perform well both mechanically and thermally as crash absorbers and thermal dissipators, respectively. Such lattices can be trivial in the case of automobiles where they can be adapted to replace radiator fins, thereby passively dissipating heat and absorbing crashes with minimal coolant leakage when such events occur.

    Biomimetic hierarchical auxetic honeycomb cells for impact absorption: Auxetic honeycomb cells were given a uniform and a non-uniform stochastic Voronoi distribution within their cell walls. The cells with a non-uniform Voronoi distribution had a dense network in the walls perpendicular to the loading direction and the coarse network in the walls parallel to the loading direction, thereby maintaining a similar mass as the uniform cell. It was hypothesized that an intricate Voronoi distribution at the stress intense regions (similar to the trabecular bone of the human body) would result in a higher plastic energy absorbed than the cell with a uniform Voronoi distribution. The simulation results showed that the auxetic cell with a non-uniform Voronoi cell absorbed almost four times more energy per unit mass than the uniform auxetic cell.

    Design and Development of an electro-mechanical testbed for a Hybrid Energy Storage (HES) system: A real-life electro-mechanical EV testbed was designed and fabricated to test hybrid setups of batteries and supercapactitors (in house made active-carbon based). Remote monitoring of real-time sensor data was implemented using a ESP32 microcontroller. Multiple load profiles were made to replicate real driving scenarios for stress testing the HES system. The tesbed was later found useful to measure much higher capacitances (from the discharge profiles) of supercapacitors, which wasn't possible with convention LCR meters.
